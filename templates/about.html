<h2>About Bet on Regret</h2>

<p><strong>Bet on Regret</strong> is an educational project aimed at revealing the mathematics behind gambling. We believe that understanding the odds is key to making informed decisions — whether you're playing for fun, researching risk, or trying to beat the house (spoiler: you probably won't).</p>

<p>This site was created to simulate popular casino games like roulette and craps, and show users how the house edge works over time. It's designed to be interactive, transparent, and accessible for everyone — from casual gamblers to math geeks.</p>

<h3>Who Made This?</h3>
<p>Developed by 4 college students at the University of Colorado Boulder. This project is designed to combine fun and entertainment with good old-fashioned probability. Our goal is to promote awareness around gambling myths, odds, and risk perception — not to encourage betting.</p>

<h3>Why the Name?</h3>
<p>“Bet on Regret” is a tongue-in-cheek reminder of what happens when you gamble against math. Eventually, the house always wins.</p>

<h3>Want to Help?</h3>
<p>Feel free to look through the cite for free. We made this website with the idea that there would be no monetary gain</p>
